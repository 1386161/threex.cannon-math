# threex.math

**Experimental** polyfill to merge three.js and cannon.js Vector3/Vec3 with functionlity from the other, so that no conversion of objects is needed between libraries.

Cannon.js: Commit 569730f (May 3, 2016)
Three.js: Commit e6aeced (May 5, 2018)

**Status**: Most functions were compatible, but some provided different functionality with the same inputs and types. Most features of the libraries worked properly with these changes, but incompatibilities did arise that needed underlying changes to the libraries.
